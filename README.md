Task 2: Spring REST
Please write a Spring REST controller that handles user registration. The REST resource should be accessible via "/userservice/register" and
accepts following JSON data:
{
"firstName": "Some first name",
"lastName": "The last name",
"userName": "The user name",
"password": "The password in plain text"
}
In case of success it should return the user object without the password:
{
"id": "Id generated by the back-end",
"firstName": "Some first name",
"lastName": "The last name",
"userName": "The user name"
}
In case the username is already existing, an error response should be returned with HTTP error-code 409:
{
"code": "USER_ALREADY_EXISTS",
"description": "A user with the given username already exists"
}
Preconditions
You have an user-repository service available which you can autowire into the REST controller:
package com.staxter.userrepository;
public interface UserRepository{
User createUser( User user ) throws UserAlreadyExistsException;
}
And following data object
package com.staxter.userrepository;
public class User{
private String id;
private String firstName;
private String lastName;
private String userName;
private String plainTextPassword;
private String hashedPassword;
// Getter and setter omitted for readability
}
Important!
We run a lot of microservices on quite weak machines. That’s why we take care of it’s size. Please use external libraries wisely.
Bonus task
- Write login logic;
- Write and deliver a running Spring Boot application (without database).
Extra bonus task
Write unit tests for the REST controller handling all use cases.
